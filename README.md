Human Face Detection Project
Overview

This project implements a real-time human face detection system using YOLOv8, OpenCV, and Streamlit. The system detects faces in images and live video streams while providing performance metrics such as Precision, Recall, Accuracy, and F1-score.

The solution is designed for applications in security, access control, retail analytics, healthcare, automotive safety, and entertainment.

Features

Data preprocessing and cleaning in YOLO format (images + labels)

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations (faces per image, bounding box statistics, etc.)

Model training using YOLOv8

Performance evaluation with metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, Accuracy, and mAP

Streamlit web application for:
